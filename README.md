react-piano-openai
==============

This is a piano application using [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) built in React with the help of [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/).

# Motivation

I am trying to test how an AI, in this case `OpenAI ChatGPT`, could help a developer to create something.

Here are the screenshots of the conversation:

I adapted the given code from vanilla JS to be used in React and with minor changes this is what I ended up making. And it works! :)

It is very amazing how far AI technology have come.
Rather than seeing it as a threat, I think AI can complement the work of developers.
The immediate effect, I think, is that this could replace, to a certain degree, using forums. Often times, specially the beginners, they face snarky replies when asking questions in such sites. Using AI would be a definite improvement.
